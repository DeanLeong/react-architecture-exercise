## Getting Started

1. Fork
2. Clone

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

- Create nice diagrams to exhibit react component hierarchy
- Have clarity in react architecture and understand the codebase better
- Have knowledge of how to use a diagram tool like whimsical

# Exercise: Create a diagram

Your task is to use [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com) to create a beautiful diagram. 

Some thoughts to contemplate as you create your react diagram:

What is the component hierarchy in this app?
- For example, the App component calls which components? And those components call what components? This should be clear in the diagram.

How do I differentiate a screen component vs a component in the components folder? Different color perhaps?

How am I diagraming the Layout component since it uses `props.children`?

How am I diagraming the services in this app? Is it clear which component uses which service?
- For example, the Products component uses the `getProducts()` service
